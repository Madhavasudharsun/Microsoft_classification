1. Problem Statement and Data Overview The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents based on various features extracted from security alerts. The dataset included a wide range of features, such as organizational identifiers, alert titles, categories, and other security-related information.
2. Data Preprocessing
Class Imbalance Handling: The dataset exhibited a class imbalance, with the majority class outnumbering the minority classes. To address this, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was employed to balance the class distribution in the training data. This step was crucial to ensure that the model did not become biased towards the majority class, which could lead to poor performance on minority classes.
Feature Engineering: Feature importance analysis revealed that certain features, such as OrgId, AlertTitle, and DetectorId, had a significant impact on the model's predictions. These features were carefully retained and engineered to improve model accuracy.
3. Model Selection and Training
Decision Tree Classifier: A Decision Tree model was chosen due to its interpretability and ability to handle complex datasets. The initial model was trained with default parameters, and the results indicated a decent performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: To further improve the Decision Tree model, GridSearchCV was used to perform hyperparameter tuning. The tuning process identified that the best model configuration included the entropy criterion, no maximum depth, no maximum features, a minimum of 1 sample per leaf, and a minimum of 2 samples required to split an internal node.
4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy and Classification Report: The tuned Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 89.7% on the test set. The classification report showed that the model performed well across all classes, with particularly strong performance for the majority class (class 0) which is BenignPositive.
Cross-Validation: Cross-validation was used to validate the model's performance, resulting in an average accuracy of 95.1% across 5 folds. This step was critical in ensuring that the model's performance was consistent and not just a result of overfitting to the training data.
5. Feature Importance Analysis
Model-Specific Importance: The most important features for the Decision Tree model were OrgId, AlertTitle, and DetectorId. These features were essential for making accurate predictions.
Permutation Importance: This analysis confirmed the importance of the top features and also highlighted the relative insignificance of some features, such as City_Encoded and Season.
6. Challenges and Solutions
Class Imbalance: The initial model struggled with class imbalance, but this was effectively addressed using SMOTE, which significantly improved the model's performance on minority classes.
Long Hyperparameter Tuning Time: The Random Forest model's hyperparameter tuning took more than 3 hours, leading to the process being interrupted. This highlighted the need for more efficient tuning strategies, such as using randomized search or reducing the parameter grid size.
7. Key Findings and Model Performance
The Decision Tree model, after hyperparameter tuning, achieved a strong overall performance with an accuracy of 89.7% on the test set.
The model was particularly effective in classifying the majority class but also demonstrated good performance on the minority classes after addressing the imbalance with SMOTE.
The feature importance analysis provided insights into which features were most influential, helping to streamline future model development efforts.
8. Recommendations
Integration into SOC Workflows: The model can be integrated into Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows to prioritize incident response based on the predicted severity of security incidents. This could help in automating the triage process, allowing analysts to focus on the most critical incidents.
Future Improvements: Future work could explore more advanced ensemble methods or neural networks to potentially improve classification performance. Additionally, the use of feature selection techniques could reduce model complexity and improve interpretability.
Deployment Considerations: For deployment, the model should be continuously monitored and retrained as new data becomes available to ensure its performance remains robust. It would also be beneficial to incorporate feedback loops from SOC analysts to refine the model over time.
